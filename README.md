This project is designed as a clean starting point for building scalable frontend applications using the latest React and Next.js architecture.

The template focuses on:

- modern project structure
- server-first architecture
- reusable UI layer
- fast development workflow
- maintainable codebase

# Tailwind + HeroUI Setup

The project integrates **HeroUI** with **Tailwind CSS** to provide a flexible UI component system.

Key configuration includes:

- Tailwind configuration
- HeroUI plugin integration
- global styling
- UI provider setup

Providers are registered inside:

```
src/app/providers.tsx
```

and injected in the root layout.

# Development Philosophy

This starter template follows several architectural principles:

### Server-first components

Next.js server components are used by default to improve performance and reduce client-side JavaScript.

### Client components for interaction

Interactive UI components (buttons, forms, animations) are isolated as client components.

### UI abstraction

UI libraries are wrapped inside reusable components to avoid tight coupling with third-party libraries.
